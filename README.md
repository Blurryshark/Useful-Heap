# Useful-Heap
Repository of my personal programming projects that I am making on my way to becoming a master Code-Buster!

To me, there's nothing more fun and engaging then solving a puzzle. Anyone who's even looked at a line of code knows that there's puzzles to be put together and riddles to solve,
and thats how I tend to approach my code. What is the function of this code? What are the potential flaws? Can this code be streamlined? What new techniques am I going to have to
learn to get this program to run in the first place? Once all that is solved and the program runs smoothe and clean, we get to dress up the code and make it as pretty as possiple
to the user. I like to give my programs aditude and leave a little bit of my own personality behind with them to the end that when the user interracts with a program that prints 
report cards or sorting numbers, they can enjoy their experience just a little bit more, and I can enjoy coding just a little bit more.
